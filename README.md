Reportula is a php based web program that provides you a summarized output stats of Bacula Backups jobs, clients, volumes and director that have
already run. It obtains its information from your catalog database.

This is a fairly high level bacula management tool. Here are a few points that one user made concerning this important tool.

It is web-based so can be accessed from anywhere.

It packs a phenomenal amount of information into a single web-page â€“ that I credit as being very good design!
